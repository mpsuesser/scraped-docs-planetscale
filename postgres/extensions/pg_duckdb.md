We don’t recommend running `pg_duckdb` directly on your PlanetScale Postgres database as it can consume significant resources during analytical queries. If you want to use DuckDB for analytics, we recommend using [MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com/) to host your analytical workloads separately.

## Dashboard Configuration

This extension requires activation via the PlanetScale dashboard before it can be used. It must be enabled through shared libraries and requires a database restart.

To enable pg\_duckdb:

## Parameters

### duckdb.postgres\_role

- **Type**: String
- **Default**: `pscale_superuser`
- **Description**: Specifies the Postgres role that is allowed to use DuckDB execution and manage secrets.

### duckdb.memory\_limit

- **Type**: Integer
- **Default**: 0
- **Description**: Maximum memory DuckDB can use per connection in megabytes. Setting to 0 activates DuckDB’s default (80% of available RAM).

## Usage

After enabling the extension through the dashboard, you can install it in your database:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_duckdb;
```

Once installed, you can use DuckDB’s analytical capabilities directly from PostgreSQL. For example:

```sql
-- Query PostgreSQL tables using DuckDB's analytical engine
SELECT * FROM duckdb.read_parquet('s3://bucket/data.parquet');
```
